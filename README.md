# Time Series Forecasting Using Prophet

## Project Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting, utilizing the Facebook Prophet library to predict future trends based on historical data. The primary dataset analyzed involves a company's sales quantities, and the goal is to identify macro trends, seasonal patterns, and other key components that influence the data over time.

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of data science, extracting meaningful insights from temporal data is crucial for informed decision-making. This project explores the application of time series forecasting, a powerful methodology used to predict future trends based on historical data, within the context of a company's revenue dynamics.

The primary tools used in this analysis include `pandas`, `seaborn`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`, and Facebook's `Prophet` library. This README details the steps involved in processing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Technological Foundations

### Libraries Used:
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data processing and manipulation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing linear regression to identify macro trends.
- **Facebook Prophet**: For advanced time series forecasting, handling seasonality, holidays, and other special events.

## Data Preprocessing

Before forecasting, the dataset underwent significant preprocessing:

1. **Handling Null Values**: 
   - Identified and visualized missing data using heatmaps.
   - Employed strategies for handling these gaps, such as imputation.

2. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Converted the 'Period' column to datetime format, which is essential for chronological data ordering.

3. **Rolling Average Calculation**:
   - Computed a rolling average to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

## Time Series Forecasting with Prophet

### Data Preparation:
- Selected and renamed the necessary columns to align with Prophet's requirements.
  
### Model Training & Forecasting:
- Trained the Prophet model using the historical sales data.
- Generated future sales forecasts by extending the date range of the dataset.
  
### Visualization:
- Visualized the actual data, fitted model, and forecasted data to compare predictions with historical trends.

## Model Performance

### Cross-Validation:
- Implemented cross-validation to assess the model's accuracy over different time periods.

### Performance Metrics:
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

### Component Analysis:
- Decomposed the time series into its main components (trend, seasonality, holidays) to better understand how each factor contributes to the overall forecast.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting. By integrating various Python libraries, we successfully identified macro trends and seasonal peaks, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making. The results highlight the importance of leveraging the right tools at each stage of analysis to produce accurate and reliable forecasts.
